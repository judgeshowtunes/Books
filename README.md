# Books
This repository contains snapshots of a number of books I have "in work". 

Software Engineering According to Kinser -- an informal textbook for the courses I teach at ETSU
Engineer - a fictional post-apocalyptic short story that I thing could be a novel
Never Do This - a memoir that I hope to finish (by not creating anymore stories to put in it)
BAware - a fictional story about a programmer that accidentally destroyed the world
